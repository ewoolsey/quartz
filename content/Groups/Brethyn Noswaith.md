alias: Noswaith, Those of Star and Sky

The tip of [The Forlorn Shiver](../Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver.md), is home to an old civilization of men and women who call themselves [Brethyn Noswaith](Brethyn%20Noswaith.md). The leaders of these people are a group of 5 elders who together form the [Primevil Speakers](Primevil%20Speakers.md). Ascending into this position of leadership is highly respected by many [Noswaith](Brethyn%20Noswaith.md) people (of which there are approximately 1200).

The core of what constitutes [The Noswaith](Brethyn%20Noswaith.md) people is their close connection with the stars and the night sky. Over generations they have created some of the finest lenses and optics ever crafted in this world in an effort to gain a greater understanding of what lies in the realms beyond. Stationed atop the highest point of *Mount Chiron* (The tallest mountain on Shiver) is the [Noswaith Observatory](../Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver/Noswaith%20Observatory.md). This location is both a revered sanctuary for the Noswaith people, and also the nexus for the scientific research that the Noswaith take part in. [Myrrdin's](../People/Party/Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md) close relationship with [Nikephoros](../People/Nikephoros.md) led him to spending much of his adolescent life here. The dome-like observatory is so imposingly large and sits upon such a prominent spot on the island that many know it as the [The Great Eye of the Forlorn Shiver](../Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver/Noswaith%20Observatory.md). The magics that run and power the observatory are drawn through connections to the deep routes that run to the core of the island. Some even tell stories that the observatory itself functions as the eye of Shiver in a more literal sense, giving Shiver an awareness of it’s surroundings and adjusting it’s location in the cloud sea accordingly.

The Noswaith don’t want to be found. Many of them are scared of what lies beyond their home. Using their observatory they've witnessed other sky ships or shards floating at great distances, and made the conscious decision not to reach out. As far as [Myrrdin Chosaach](../People/Party/Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md) and the rest of the noswaith are concerned, They haven't been discovered by any outsiders.

The source of the Noswaith's knowledge is multifaceted. Some knowledge has been recovered through various tribe members [A’lawdrinaieths](../Things/A'lawdrinaieth.md). Some knowledge is likely a little hazy since many stories have been passed down over dozens of generations. There are a select few Noswaith, known as the [Ymarferydd](Ymarferydd.md), who are able to directly commune with the [eidolons](../Deities/Eidolons%20of%20The%20Forlorn%20Shiver.md). Some people say the more powerful eidolons seek out men and woman all across the cloud sea in an effort to form a connection with humanity, and with the world at large. These communions are usually very private. There are a dozen or so Noswaith that have claimed to commune directly with the spirits, Myrrdin has longed to seek them out but as of yet has been unsuccessful. During these communions, both knowledge, power, and kinship are shared between both parties. Though most [Ymarferydd](Ymarferydd.md) are scarce about the details they share about these meetings to others.

[Myrrdin](../People/Party/Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md) grew up listening to tales told by his [elders](Primevil%20Speakers.md) during tribal gatherings. Some of the most notable chronicles he recalls hearing from his uncle [Nikephoros](../People/Nikephoros.md) include:

Before there was man or women, beast or burden, and even before the so-called [First Born](../Deities/First%20Born.md), there were the [Elemensus Primeval](../Deities/Elemental%20Primordials/Elemental%20Primordials.md). Rather than living and coexisting with earth, fire, sea and sky, they *were* the elements. Their bodies making up the entirety of the known landscape.

This was the fable from [Myrrdin's](../People/Party/Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md) youth that rang most true to him. The [Elemental Primordials](../Deities/Elemental%20Primordials/Elemental%20Primordials.md) having no eyes had no need for light. The [First Born](../Deities/First%20Born.md), arriving after aeons of peaceful existence through sheer force of will grew tired of the darkness. Seeking a source of light they gathered up large swaths of elemental chaos and forced it under immense heat and pressure and cast it out into the farthest reaches of the universe, forming the first stars. A *calamitous battle* then ensued resulting in the macroscopic destruction of the titans. The only remaining proof of their existence being [lesser eidolons](../Deities/Eidolons%20of%20The%20Forlorn%20Shiver.md) that roam the last remaining sanctuaries of their worship, and the stars themselves, still burning with the energy of the elemental chaos.
