  A Strange Encounter at Depths
---

[Myrrdin](/People/Party/Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md) and [Therapydd](/People/Therapydd.md) (His friend that disappeared 3 years ago on his [A'lawdrinaieth](/Things/A'lawdrinaieth.md)) were close friends for all though their childhood. They would often find themselves in spirited competition with one another. During a challenge to see who could free dive the deepest in lake [Lynn Ail-Lenwi](/Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver/Lynn%20Ail-Lenwi.md), they both dove miles beneath the surface as the can hold their breath indefinitely. At near incomprehensible depths they both heard *an unfamiliar voice* coming from deep below the lake. At first they were overjoyed that they were being approached by the [eidolons](/Deities/Eidolons%20of%20The%20Forlorn%20Shiver.md), but they quickly became unnerved by an unexplained feeling in the back of their minds. Unsure of weather they were contacted by the eidolons, or something much more sinister, but they never dared to go back to those depths.
