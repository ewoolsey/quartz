title: A Lost Friend
---

3 years ago, One of [Myrrdin's](People/Party/Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md) closest friends [Therapydd](People/Therapydd.md), set off on his own [A'lawdrinaieth](Things/A'lawdrinaieth.md) leaving off of [The Forlorn Shiver](Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver.md) never to be seen again. Myrrdin spent hours every day with his hand crafted set of lenses scoping out the skies in search of his friend, only to make sight of a sky ship. Seizing the opportunity with a make shift paraglider he left off of shivers tip and touched down upon this air ship. The descent to this ship was perhaps a little rougher than he was expecting and he broke both a lens from his telescope, and a spar from his paraglider. Myrrdin was surprisingly well received on this ship be welcomed by a woman who went by [Captain Amara](People/Captain%20Amara.md), a falchion wielding, adventurer with shining dark skin and hair clad in gold trimmed armour and jewellery.
