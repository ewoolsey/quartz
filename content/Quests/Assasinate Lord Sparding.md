[Hariotte Sparding](People/Hariotte%20Sparding.md) asked us to travel to the [Knuckle Mountains](Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/Gramerai/Knuckle%20Mountains.md) in order to retake the *Sparding Family Castle* from the *undead*. The mission was to assassinate *Hector Sparding* who had turned into a *Revenants* due to the [Grave Winter](Events/Grave%20Winter.md).
