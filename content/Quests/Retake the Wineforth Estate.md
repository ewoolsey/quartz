  Retake the Wineforth Estate
---

We were tasked by *a member of the wineforth family* to retake the *Wineforth Estate*. The [Wineforth Family](Groups/Wineforth%20Family.md) is quite wealthy. The [Party](People/Party/Party.md) travelled to the [Lower Green](Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/Gramerai/Lower%20Green.md) and retook the estate, But also stole significant *magical items* and coin from the vault. They have yet to return to collect the reward.
