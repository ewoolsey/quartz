An A'lawdrinaieth is a trial or challenge, that many people of the [Brethyn Noswaith](Groups/Brethyn%20Noswaith.md) attempt during young adulthood. The trial usually consists of a long, open-ended, exploratory mission that culminates in the discovery of knowledge with scientific or cultural significance and to uncover mysteries of the Noswaith's past, their originâ€™s on the forlorn shiver, and their connection with the stars. Many young Noswaith Men and Women have done this in the past, mostly exploring the cliffs on shivers exposed edges, or the deep caverns within its depths. ^64e6cf
