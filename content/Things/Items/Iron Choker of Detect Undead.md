  Iron Choker of Detect Undead
---

A choker of cold black iron, set with three studs of polished steel. The wearer may use their action to sense undead until the end of their current turn, determining in generalities the presence and direction to any undead within 500 ft. If there are undead within 60 ft, the wearer senses the exact position of each undead, so long as there are not more than 5 ft of solid material (stone, earth, etc.) between the wearer and the undead. The choker holds three charges, recharging 1d4 on long rest.

The Choker was found to the east of [Candle Stone](/Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/Gramerai/Candle%20Stone/Candle%20Stone.md) in a small village and was recovered from a *Revenant*. It is currently worn by [Myrrdin Chosaach](/People/Party/Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md).
