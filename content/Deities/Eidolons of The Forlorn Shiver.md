  Eidolons of The Forlorn Shiver
---

The Eidolons of the [Elemensus Primeval](/Deities/Elemental%20Primordials/Elemental%20Primordials.md) are all that remain of the once great Titans. There presence stretches far and wide across the [Cloud Sea](/Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Cloud%20Sea.md) but are particularly active on [The Forlorn Shiver](/Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver.md). The eidolons speak directly to the [Ymarferydd](/Groups/Ymarferydd.md) of the [Brethyn Noswaith](/Groups/Brethyn%20Noswaith.md).
