alias: Elemensus Primeval

Before there was man or women, beast or burden, and even before the so-called [First Born](../First%20Born.md), there were the [Elemensus Primeval](Elemental%20Primordials.md). Rather than living and coexisting with earth, fire, sea and sky, they *were* the elements. Their bodies making up the entirety of the known landscape.

This was the fable from [Myrrdin's](../../People/Party/Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md) youth that rang most true to him. The [Elemental Primordials](Elemental%20Primordials.md) having no eyes had no need for light. The [First Born](../First%20Born.md), arriving after aeons of peaceful existence through sheer force of will grew tired of the darkness. Seeking a source of light they gathered up large swaths of elemental chaos and forced it under immense heat and pressure and cast it out into the farthest reaches of the universe, forming the first stars. A *calamitous battle* then ensued resulting in the macroscopic destruction of the titans. The only remaining proof of their existence being [lesser eidolons](../Eidolons%20of%20The%20Forlorn%20Shiver.md) that roam the last remaining sanctuaries of their worship, and the stars themselves, still burning with the energy of the elemental chaos.
