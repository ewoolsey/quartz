  The Forlorn Shiver
---

[Myrrdin Chosaach](/People/Party/Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md), born upon one of the oldest and most ancient [Shards](/Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/Shards.md) referred to by its denizens as [The Forlorn Shiver](/Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver.md). Many [Shards](/Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/Shards.md) in this world tend to frequently drift by each other in close proximity, but the shiver seems to drift the endless skies with a mind of its own, always managing to avoid nearby interactions, always managing to stay hidden to all but the [most observant](/Groups/Human%20Kingdom.md). The shiver is a long needle-like land mass with its tip nearly 5 miles wide, and its length some many hundreds of miles across. Atop its peak is a lush sanctuary filled with trees that tower 1000s of feet high and a plethora of *strange oversized animals*, many of which are friendly, though some definitely are not. At the centre of this sanctuary is crystal clear lake, [Lynn Ail-Lenwi](/Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver/Lynn%20Ail-Lenwi.md), which plunges to depths never before explored, some say these depths are a portal to a *far off world entirely submerged in water*. Shiver is home to the [Brethyn Noswaith](/Groups/Brethyn%20Noswaith.md).
