Candle Stone is the capital city of the island of [Gramerai](Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/Gramerai/Gramerai.md), and was the only area able to withstand the effects of the [Grave Winter](Events/Grave%20Winter.md). One of it's primary landmarks is the [Grand Lighthouse](Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/Gramerai/Candle%20Stone/Grand%20Lighthouse.md), which is now being used as a site of warship for the religion known as [Light Crusade](Groups/Light%20Crusade.md).
