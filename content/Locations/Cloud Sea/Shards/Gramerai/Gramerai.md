[Gramerai](/Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/Gramerai/Gramerai.md) is a large island floating within the [Cloud Sea](/Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Cloud%20Sea.md). It was the central point hit by a large winter storm known as the [Grave Winter](/Events/Grave%20Winter.md), which brought large amounts of undead soldiers to the island, leaving it uninhabitable.
