A first generation *Gnome* and member of the [Quill Society](Groups/Quill%20Society.md). Sent the [Party](People/Party/Party.md) on a task to some ruins to the north of [Rifton](Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/Rifton/Rifton.md) to recover some ancient draconic artifacts from the [First Age](Events/First%20Age.md). Seems like a nice guy.
