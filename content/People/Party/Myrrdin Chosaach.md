# Appearance

Appearance: Myrrdin Chosach is a 19yr old humanoid male with sky blue skin. Soft patches of white undulate around his exterior almost giving the illusion of clouds rolling across his person. Standing closer you can see Myrrdin's complexion is almost translucent at times.

# Backstory

From a young age Myrrdin Chosaach knew that he was meant to lead his people. He felt a strong link between himself and the cosmos, noticing strong connections and divinations between the stars and the material plane. In an effort to prove himself worthy of becoming a [Primevil Speakers](Groups/Primevil%20Speakers.md) he decided to undertake a challenge known as an [A'lawdrinaieth](Things/A'lawdrinaieth.md).

Myrrdin has a *mother*, *father* and *sister* that he cares for very much, and whom care for him in return. He spends as much time with them as a son would, but his relationship with his uncle [Nikephoros](People/Nikephoros.md) is particularly strong. Nikephoros is one of the 13 [Ymarferydd](Groups/Ymarferydd.md) on Shiver, capable of speaking directly with the [eidolons](Deities/Eidolons%20of%20The%20Forlorn%20Shiver.md). He is a prime candidate to become one of the [Primevil Speakers](Groups/Primevil%20Speakers.md) of [Brethyn Noswaith](Groups/Brethyn%20Noswaith.md). When a Primeval Speaker passes on to the next realm, a challenge is initiated (Feel free to go crazy with this if it ever comes up) that any established member of the Noswaith (who has completed their [A'lawdrinaieth](Things/A'lawdrinaieth.md)) can enter. Currently 2 of the 5 elders are becoming particularly old and frail, and the Noswaith people are concerned that [Nikephoros](People/Nikephoros.md) may be too liberal to take their place

# Hooks

3 years ago, One of [Myrrdin's](People/Party/Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md) closest friends [Therapydd](People/Therapydd.md), set off on his own [A'lawdrinaieth](Things/A'lawdrinaieth.md) leaving off of [The Forlorn Shiver](Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver.md) never to be seen again. Myrrdin spent hours every day with his hand crafted set of lenses scoping out the skies in search of his friend, only to make sight of a sky ship. Seizing the opportunity with a make shift paraglider he left off of shivers tip and touched down upon this air ship. The descent to this ship was perhaps a little rougher than he was expecting and he broke both a lens from his telescope, and a spar from his paraglider. Myrrdin was surprisingly well received on this ship be welcomed by a woman who went by [Captain Amara](People/Captain%20Amara.md), a falchion wielding, adventurer with shining dark skin and hair clad in gold trimmed armour and jewellery.

[Myrrdin](People/Party/Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md) and [Therapydd](People/Therapydd.md) (His friend that disappeared 3 years ago on his [A'lawdrinaieth](Things/A'lawdrinaieth.md)) were close friends for all though their childhood. They would often find themselves in spirited competition with one another. During a challenge to see who could free dive the deepest in lake [Lynn Ail-Lenwi](Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver/Lynn%20Ail-Lenwi.md), they both dove miles beneath the surface as the can hold their breath indefinitely. At near incomprehensible depths they both heard *an unfamiliar voice* coming from deep below the lake. At first they were overjoyed that they were being approached by the [eidolons](Deities/Eidolons%20of%20The%20Forlorn%20Shiver.md), but they quickly became unnerved by an unexplained feeling in the back of their minds. Unsure of weather they were contacted by the eidolons, or something much more sinister, but they never dared to go back to those depths.

* [world entirely submerged in water](Locations/world%20entirely%20submerged%20in%20water/world%20entirely%20submerged%20in%20water.md)

[Myrrdin's](People/Party/Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md)  uncle [Nikephoros](People/Nikephoros.md) completed his own [A'lawdrinaieth](Things/A'lawdrinaieth.md) nearly 12 years ago by scaling the sheer cliffs that line the edge of the [The Forlorn Shiver](Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver.md) until he reached the very bottom, scraping against sky itself. There, [Nikephoros](People/Nikephoros.md) discovered the ruins of some ancient arcane technology. A dark energy lingered around the base of the Shiver and these ruins. [Nikephoros](People/Nikephoros.md), got too close to this structure, and when his hand made contact with it, a dark energy pulsed, radiated and perfused through [Nikephoros](People/Nikephoros.md) himself, and the entire island at large, seemingly activated by his presence. Since that day 12 years ago, a corrupting energy has slowly been creeping it's way up to the top of the shiver, almost as if the sheer cliffs on it's edge were rusting and turning a sickly reddish colour. Large boulders from its edge calving and falling into the depths of the [Cloud Sea](Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Cloud%20Sea.md).

Since these events, The [elders](Groups/Primevil%20Speakers.md) of the [Brethyn Noswaith](Groups/Brethyn%20Noswaith.md) have sent other scouts to the bottom of the shiver, and they deduced that the source of this corruption was from the fracturing of an ancient and powerful artifact, A weapon given the name the [Spire of the Solar Wind](Things/Items/Spire%20of%20the%20Solar%20Wind.md). No one is sure what's has caused this artifact to fracture in two, only that the other half is out there somewhere, perhaps attached to the base of another shard, perhaps stuck at the bottomless depths of the [Cloud Sea](Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Cloud%20Sea.md).

When [Myrrdin](People/Party/Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md) left the [Shiver](Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver.md) to complete his [A'lawdrinaieth](Things/A'lawdrinaieth.md) he was tasked by the [Primevil Speakers](Groups/Primevil%20Speakers.md) to seek out a woman who's name was written in the stars directly at the zenith of the [The Forlorn Shiver](Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver.md). A Women by the name of *Sidereum*. The Elders divinations could not reveal much more about this mysterious person, only that she would play an important role in the solution to this dire problem, and that perhaps [Myrrdin](People/Party/Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md), guided by the stars themselves,  would be fortunate enough to cross her path.

[Myrrdin](People/Party/Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md) learned a little from the [crew](People/Captain%20Amara.md) of the airship that he landed on. 

The human empire lives on a far away [shard](Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/Shards.md) known has [Hearthen](Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/Hearthen/Hearthen.md).

The *human king*, a spoiled and lazy scion of a powerful line, has recently been overthrown by his *younger sister*. Seemingly overnight, the [Human Kingdom](Groups/Human%20Kingdom.md) has been transformed into an aggressive, expansionist empire bent on domination. Might spell trouble for the [Noswaith](Groups/Brethyn%20Noswaith.md), if they were ever found ^26e9ed
