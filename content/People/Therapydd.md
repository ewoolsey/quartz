  Therapydd

Therapydd was one of [Myrrdin Chosaach's](People/Party/Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md) life long friends from a young age.

[Myrrdin](People/Party/Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md) and [Therapydd](People/Therapydd.md) (His friend that disappeared 3 years ago on his [A'lawdrinaieth](Things/A'lawdrinaieth.md)) were close friends for all though their childhood. They would often find themselves in spirited competition with one another. During a challenge to see who could free dive the deepest in lake [Lynn Ail-Lenwi](Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver/Lynn%20Ail-Lenwi.md), they both dove miles beneath the surface as the can hold their breath indefinitely. At near incomprehensible depths they both heard *an unfamiliar voice* coming from deep below the lake. At first they were overjoyed that they were being approached by the [eidolons](Deities/Eidolons%20of%20The%20Forlorn%20Shiver.md), but they quickly became unnerved by an unexplained feeling in the back of their minds. Unsure of weather they were contacted by the eidolons, or something much more sinister, but they never dared to go back to those depths.

3 years ago, One of [Myrrdin's](People/Party/Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md) closest friends [Therapydd](People/Therapydd.md), set off on his own [A'lawdrinaieth](Things/A'lawdrinaieth.md) leaving off of [The Forlorn Shiver](Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver.md) never to be seen again. Myrrdin spent hours every day with his hand crafted set of lenses scoping out the skies in search of his friend, only to make sight of a sky ship. Seizing the opportunity with a make shift paraglider he left off of shivers tip and touched down upon this air ship. The descent to this ship was perhaps a little rougher than he was expecting and he broke both a lens from his telescope, and a spar from his paraglider. Myrrdin was surprisingly well received on this ship be welcomed by a woman who went by [Captain Amara](People/Captain%20Amara.md), a falchion wielding, adventurer with shining dark skin and hair clad in gold trimmed armour and jewellery.
