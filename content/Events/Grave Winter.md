title: Grave Winter
---

The Grave Winter was a terrible winter storm that swept the island of [Gramerai](../Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/Gramerai/Gramerai.md). It lasted for around 5 years, and in that time it brought thousands of undead and decimated the population of the island, except for the city of [Candle Stone](../Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/Gramerai/Candle%20Stone/Candle%20Stone.md).
