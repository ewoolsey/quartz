The leaders of these people are a group of 5 elders who together form the [Primevil Speakers](Primevil%20Speakers.md). Ascending into this position of leadership is highly respected by many [Noswaith](Brethyn%20Noswaith.md) people (of which there are approximately 1200).\n\nThe core of what constitutes [The Noswaith](Brethyn%20Noswaith.md) people is their close connection with the stars and the night sky. Over generations they have created some of the finest lenses and optics ever crafted in this world in an effort to gain a greater understanding of what lies in the realms beyond. Stationed atop the highest point of *Mount Chiron* (The tallest mountain on Shiver) is the [Noswaith Observatory](../Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver/Noswaith%20Observatory.md). This location is both a revered sanctuary for the Noswaith people, and also the nexus for the scientific research that the Noswaith take part in. [Myrrdin's](../People/Party/Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md) close relationship with [Nikephoros](../People/Nikephoros.md) led him to spending much of his adolescent life here. The dome-like observatory is so imposingly large and sits upon such a prominent spot on the island that many know it as the [The Great Eye of the Forlorn Shiver](../Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver/Noswaith%20Observatory.md). The magics that run and power the observatory are drawn through connections to the deep routes that run to the core of the island. Some even tell stories that the observatory itself functions as the eye of Shiver in a more literal sense, giving Shiver an awareness of it’s surroundings and adjusting it’s location in the cloud sea accordingly.\n\nThe Noswaith don’t want to be found. Many of them are scared of what lies beyond their home. Using their observatory they've witnessed other sky ships or shards floating at great distances, and made the conscious decision not to reach out. As far as [Myrrdin Chosaach](../People/Party/Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md) and the rest of the noswaith are concerned, They haven't been discovered by any outsiders.\n\nThe source of the Noswaith's knowledge is multifaceted. Some knowledge has been recovered through various tribe members [A’lawdrinaieths](../Things/A'lawdrinaieth.md). Some knowledge is likely a little hazy since many stories have been passed down over dozens of generations. There are a select few Noswaith, known as the [Ymarferydd](Ymarferydd.md), who are able to directly commune with the [eidolons](../Deities/Eidolons%20of%20The%20Forlorn%20Shiver.md). Some people say the more powerful eidolons seek out men and woman all across the cloud sea in an effort to form a connection with humanity, and with the world at large. These communions are usually very private. There are a dozen or so Noswaith that have claimed to commune directly with the spirits, Myrrdin has longed to seek them out but as of yet has been unsuccessful. During these communions, both knowledge, power, and kinship are shared between both parties. Though most [Ymarferydd](Ymarferydd.md) are scarce about the details they share about these meetings to others.\n\n[Myrrdin](../People/Party/Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md) grew up listening to tales told by his [elders](Primevil%20Speakers.md) during tribal gatherings. Some of the most notable chronicles he recalls hearing from his uncle [Nikephoros](../People/Nikephoros.md) include:\n\nBefore there was man or women, beast or burden, and even before the so-called [First Born](../Deities/First%20Born.md), there were the [Elemensus Primeval](../Deities/Elemental%20Primordials/Elemental%20Primordials.md).

Soft patches of white undulate around his exterior almost giving the illusion of clouds rolling across his person. Standing closer you can see Myrrdin's complexion is almost translucent at times.\n\n# Backstory\n\nFrom a young age Myrrdin Chosaach knew that he was meant to lead his people. He felt a strong link between himself and the cosmos, noticing strong connections and divinations between the stars and the material plane. In an effort to prove himself worthy of becoming a [Primevil Speakers](../../Groups/Primevil%20Speakers.md) he decided to undertake a challenge known as an [A'lawdrinaieth](../../Things/A'lawdrinaieth.md).\n\nMyrrdin has a *mother*, *father* and *sister* that he cares for very much, and whom care for him in return. He spends as much time with them as a son would, but his relationship with his uncle [Nikephoros](../Nikephoros.md) is particularly strong. Nikephoros is one of the 13 [Ymarferydd](../../Groups/Ymarferydd.md) on Shiver, capable of speaking directly with the [eidolons](../../Deities/Eidolons%20of%20The%20Forlorn%20Shiver.md). He is a prime candidate to become one of the [Primevil Speakers](../../Groups/Primevil%20Speakers.md) of [Brethyn Noswaith](../../Groups/Brethyn%20Noswaith.md). When a Primeval Speaker passes on to the next realm, a challenge is initiated (Feel free to go crazy with this if it ever comes up) that any established member of the Noswaith (who has completed their [A'lawdrinaieth](../../Things/A'lawdrinaieth.md)) can enter. Currently 2 of the 5 elders are becoming particularly old and frail, and the Noswaith people are concerned that [Nikephoros](../Nikephoros.md) may be too liberal to take their place\n\n# Hooks\n\n3 years ago, One of [Myrrdin's](Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md) closest friends [Therapydd](../Therapydd.md), set off on his own [A'lawdrinaieth](../../Things/A'lawdrinaieth.md) leaving off of [The Forlorn Shiver](../../Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver.md) never to be seen again. Myrrdin spent hours every day with his hand crafted set of lenses scoping out the skies in search of his friend, only to make sight of a sky ship. Seizing the opportunity with a make shift paraglider he left off of shivers tip and touched down upon this air ship. The descent to this ship was perhaps a little rougher than he was expecting and he broke both a lens from his telescope, and a spar from his paraglider. Myrrdin was surprisingly well received on this ship be welcomed by a woman who went by [Captain Amara](../Captain%20Amara.md), a falchion wielding, adventurer with shining dark skin and hair clad in gold trimmed armour and jewellery.\n\n[Myrrdin](Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md) and [Therapydd](../Therapydd.md) (His friend that disappeared 3 years ago on his [A'lawdrinaieth](../../Things/A'lawdrinaieth.md)) were close friends for all though their childhood. They would often find themselves in spirited competition with one another. During a challenge to see who could free dive the deepest in lake [Lynn Ail-Lenwi](../../Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver/Lynn%20Ail-Lenwi.md), they both dove miles beneath the surface as the can hold their breath indefinitely. At near incomprehensible depths they both heard *an unfamiliar voice* coming from deep below the lake. At first they were overjoyed that they were being approached by the [eidolons](../../Deities/Eidolons%20of%20The%20Forlorn%20Shiver.md), but they quickly became unnerved by an unexplained feeling in the back of their minds. Unsure of weather they were contacted by the eidolons, or something much more sinister, but they never dared to go back to those depths.\n\n* [world entirely submerged in water](../../Locations/world%20entirely%20submerged%20in%20water/world%20entirely%20submerged%20in%20water.md)\n\n[Myrrdin's](Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md)  uncle [Nikephoros](../Nikephoros.md) completed his own [A'lawdrinaieth](../../Things/A'lawdrinaieth.md) nearly 12 years ago by scaling the sheer cliffs that line the edge of the [The Forlorn Shiver](../../Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver.md) until he reached the very bottom, scraping against sky itself. There, [Nikephoros](../Nikephoros.md) discovered the ruins of some ancient arcane technology. A dark energy lingered around the base of the Shiver and these ruins. [Nikephoros](../Nikephoros.md), got too close to this structure, and when his hand made contact with it, a dark energy pulsed, radiated and perfused through [Nikephoros](../Nikephoros.md) himself, and the entire island at large, seemingly activated by his presence. Since that day 12 years ago, a corrupting energy has slowly been creeping it's way up to the top of the shiver, almost as if the sheer cliffs on it's edge were rusting and turning a sickly reddish colour. Large boulders from its edge calving and falling into the depths of the [Cloud Sea](../../Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Cloud%20Sea.md).\n\nSince these events, The [elders](../../Groups/Primevil%20Speakers.md) of the [Brethyn Noswaith](../../Groups/Brethyn%20Noswaith.md) have sent other scouts to the bottom of the shiver, and they deduced that the source of this corruption was from the fracturing of an ancient and powerful artifact, A weapon given the name the [Spire of the Solar Wind](../../Things/Items/Spire%20of%20the%20Solar%20Wind.md). No one is sure what's has caused this artifact to fracture in two, only that the other half is out there somewhere, perhaps attached to the base of another shard, perhaps stuck at the bottomless depths of the [Cloud Sea](../../Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Cloud%20Sea.md).\n\nWhen [Myrrdin](Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md) left the [Shiver](../../Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver.md) to complete his [A'lawdrinaieth](../../Things/A'lawdrinaieth.md) he was tasked by the [Primevil Speakers](../../Groups/Primevil%20Speakers.md) to seek out a woman who's name was written in the stars directly at the zenith of the [The Forlorn Shiver](../../Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver.md). A Women by the name of *Sidereum*. The Elders divinations could not reveal much more about this mysterious person, only that she would play an important role in the solution to this dire problem, and that perhaps [Myrrdin](Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md), guided by the stars themselves,  would be fortunate enough to cross her path.\n\n[Myrrdin](Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md) learned a little from the [crew](../Captain%20Amara.md) of the airship that he landed on. \n\nThe human empire lives on a far away [shard](../../Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/Shards.md) known has [Hearthen](../../Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/Hearthen/Hearthen.md).\n\nThe *human king*, a spoiled and lazy scion of a powerful line, has recently been overthrown by his *younger sister*.

The descent to this ship was perhaps a little rougher than he was expecting and he broke both a lens from his telescope, and a spar from his paraglider. Myrrdin was surprisingly well received on this ship be welcomed by a woman who went by [Captain Amara](../People/Captain%20Amara.md), a falchion wielding, adventurer with shining dark skin and hair clad in gold trimmed armour and jewellery.\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-08T22:03:41.684021754Z","tags":[]},"/Quests/A-Search-in-the-Stars":{"title":"Untitled Page","content":"---\ntags: quests/hook\ntitle: A Search in the Stars\n---\n\n[Myrrdin's](../People/Party/Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md)  uncle [Nikephoros](../People/Nikephoros.md) completed his own [A'lawdrinaieth](../Things/A'lawdrinaieth.md) nearly 12 years ago by scaling the sheer cliffs that line the edge of the [The Forlorn Shiver](../Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver.md) until he reached the very bottom, scraping against sky itself. There, [Nikephoros](../People/Nikephoros.md) discovered the ruins of some ancient arcane technology. A dark energy lingered around the base of the Shiver and these ruins. [Nikephoros](../People/Nikephoros.md), got too close to this structure, and when his hand made contact with it, a dark energy pulsed, radiated and perfused through [Nikephoros](../People/Nikephoros.md) himself, and the entire island at large, seemingly activated by his presence. Since that day 12 years ago, a corrupting energy has slowly been creeping it's way up to the top of the shiver, almost as if the sheer cliffs on it's edge were rusting and turning a sickly reddish colour.

No one is sure what's has caused this artifact to fracture in two, only that the other half is out there somewhere, perhaps attached to the base of another shard, perhaps stuck at the bottomless depths of the [Cloud Sea](../Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Cloud%20Sea.md).\n\nWhen [Myrrdin](../People/Party/Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md) left the [Shiver](../Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver.md) to complete his [A'lawdrinaieth](../Things/A'lawdrinaieth.md) he was tasked by the [Primevil Speakers](../Groups/Primevil%20Speakers.md) to seek out a woman who's name was written in the stars directly at the zenith of the [The Forlorn Shiver](../Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver.md). A Women by the name of *Sidereum*.
