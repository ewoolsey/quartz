The leaders of these people are a group of 5 elders who together form the [Primevil Speakers](Primevil%20Speakers.md). Ascending into this position of leadership is highly respected by many [Noswaith](Brethyn%20Noswaith.md) people (of which there are approximately 1200).\n\nThe core of what constitutes [The Noswaith](Brethyn%20Noswaith.md) people is their close connection with the stars and the night sky. Over generations they have created some of the finest lenses and optics ever crafted in this world in an effort to gain a greater understanding of what lies in the realms beyond. Stationed atop the highest point of *Mount Chiron* (The tallest mountain on Shiver) is the [Noswaith Observatory](../Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver/Noswaith%20Observatory.md). This location is both a revered sanctuary for the Noswaith people, and also the nexus for the scientific research that the Noswaith take part in. [Myrrdin's](../People/Party/Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md) close relationship with [Nikephoros](../People/Nikephoros.md) led him to spending much of his adolescent life here. The dome-like observatory is so imposingly large and sits upon such a prominent spot on the island that many know it as the [The Great Eye of the Forlorn Shiver](../Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver/Noswaith%20Observatory.md). The magics that run and power the observatory are drawn through connections to the deep routes that run to the core of the island. Some even tell stories that the observatory itself functions as the eye of Shiver in a more literal sense, giving Shiver an awareness of it‚Äôs surroundings and adjusting it‚Äôs location in the cloud sea accordingly.\n\nThe Noswaith don‚Äôt want to be found. Many of them are scared of what lies beyond their home. Using their observatory they've witnessed other sky ships or shards floating at great distances, and made the conscious decision not to reach out. As far as [Myrrdin Chosaach](../People/Party/Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md) and the rest of the noswaith are concerned, They haven't been discovered by any outsiders.\n\nThe source of the Noswaith's knowledge is multifaceted. Some knowledge has been recovered through various tribe members [A‚Äôlawdrinaieths](../Things/A'lawdrinaieth.md). Some knowledge is likely a little hazy since many stories have been passed down over dozens of generations. There are a select few Noswaith, known as the [Ymarferydd](Ymarferydd.md), who are able to directly commune with the [eidolons](../Deities/Eidolons%20of%20The%20Forlorn%20Shiver.md). Some people say the more powerful eidolons seek out men and woman all across the cloud sea in an effort to form a connection with humanity, and with the world at large. These communions are usually very private. There are a dozen or so Noswaith that have claimed to commune directly with the spirits, Myrrdin has longed to seek them out but as of yet has been unsuccessful. During these communions, both knowledge, power, and kinship are shared between both parties. Though most [Ymarferydd](Ymarferydd.md) are scarce about the details they share about these meetings to others.\n\n[Myrrdin](../People/Party/Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md) grew up listening to tales told by his [elders](Primevil%20Speakers.md) during tribal gatherings. Some of the most notable chronicles he recalls hearing from his uncle [Nikephoros](../People/Nikephoros.md) include:\n\nBefore there was man or women, beast or burden, and even before the so-called [First Born](../Deities/First%20Born.md), there were the [Elemensus Primeval](../Deities/Elemental%20Primordials/Elemental%20Primordials.md).

Soft patches of white undulate around his exterior almost giving the illusion of clouds rolling across his person. Standing closer you can see Myrrdin's complexion is almost translucent at times.\n\n# Backstory\n\nFrom a young age Myrrdin Chosaach knew that he was meant to lead his people. He felt a strong link between himself and the cosmos, noticing strong connections and divinations between the stars and the material plane. In an effort to prove himself worthy of becoming a [Primevil Speakers](../../Groups/Primevil%20Speakers.md) he decided to undertake a challenge known as an [A'lawdrinaieth](../../Things/A'lawdrinaieth.md).\n\nMyrrdin has a *mother*, *father* and *sister* that he cares for very much, and whom care for him in return. He spends as much time with them as a son would, but his relationship with his uncle [Nikephoros](../Nikephoros.md) is particularly strong. Nikephoros is one of the 13 [Ymarferydd](../../Groups/Ymarferydd.md) on Shiver, capable of speaking directly with the [eidolons](../../Deities/Eidolons%20of%20The%20Forlorn%20Shiver.md). He is a prime candidate to become one of the [Primevil Speakers](../../Groups/Primevil%20Speakers.md) of [Brethyn Noswaith](../../Groups/Brethyn%20Noswaith.md). When a Primeval Speaker passes on to the next realm, a challenge is initiated (Feel free to go crazy with this if it ever comes up) that any established member of the Noswaith (who has completed their [A'lawdrinaieth](../../Things/A'lawdrinaieth.md)) can enter. Currently 2 of the 5 elders are becoming particularly old and frail, and the Noswaith people are concerned that [Nikephoros](../Nikephoros.md) may be too liberal to take their place\n\n# Hooks\n\n3 years ago, One of [Myrrdin's](Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md) closest friends [Therapydd](../Therapydd.md), set off on his own [A'lawdrinaieth](../../Things/A'lawdrinaieth.md) leaving off of [The Forlorn Shiver](../../Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver.md) never to be seen again. Myrrdin spent hours every day with his hand crafted set of lenses scoping out the skies in search of his friend, only to make sight of a sky ship. Seizing the opportunity with a make shift paraglider he left off of shivers tip and touched down upon this air ship. The descent to this ship was perhaps a little rougher than he was expecting and he broke both a lens from his telescope, and a spar from his paraglider. Myrrdin was surprisingly well received on this ship be welcomed by a woman who went by [Captain Amara](../Captain%20Amara.md), a falchion wielding, adventurer with shining dark skin and hair clad in gold trimmed armour and jewellery.\n\n[Myrrdin](Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md) and [Therapydd](../Therapydd.md) (His friend that disappeared 3 years ago on his [A'lawdrinaieth](../../Things/A'lawdrinaieth.md)) were close friends for all though their childhood. They would often find themselves in spirited competition with one another. During a challenge to see who could free dive the deepest in lake [Lynn Ail-Lenwi](../../Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver/Lynn%20Ail-Lenwi.md), they both dove miles beneath the surface as the can hold their breath indefinitely. At near incomprehensible depths they both heard *an unfamiliar voice* coming from deep below the lake. At first they were overjoyed that they were being approached by the [eidolons](../../Deities/Eidolons%20of%20The%20Forlorn%20Shiver.md), but they quickly became unnerved by an unexplained feeling in the back of their minds. Unsure of weather they were contacted by the eidolons, or something much more sinister, but they never dared to go back to those depths.\n\n* [world entirely submerged in water](../../Locations/world%20entirely%20submerged%20in%20water/world%20entirely%20submerged%20in%20water.md)\n\n[Myrrdin's](Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md)  uncle [Nikephoros](../Nikephoros.md) completed his own [A'lawdrinaieth](../../Things/A'lawdrinaieth.md) nearly 12 years ago by scaling the sheer cliffs that line the edge of the [The Forlorn Shiver](../../Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver.md) until he reached the very bottom, scraping against sky itself. There, [Nikephoros](../Nikephoros.md) discovered the ruins of some ancient arcane technology. A dark energy lingered around the base of the Shiver and these ruins. [Nikephoros](../Nikephoros.md), got too close to this structure, and when his hand made contact with it, a dark energy pulsed, radiated and perfused through [Nikephoros](../Nikephoros.md) himself, and the entire island at large, seemingly activated by his presence. Since that day 12 years ago, a corrupting energy has slowly been creeping it's way up to the top of the shiver, almost as if the sheer cliffs on it's edge were rusting and turning a sickly reddish colour. Large boulders from its edge calving and falling into the depths of the [Cloud Sea](../../Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Cloud%20Sea.md).\n\nSince these events, The [elders](../../Groups/Primevil%20Speakers.md) of the [Brethyn Noswaith](../../Groups/Brethyn%20Noswaith.md) have sent other scouts to the bottom of the shiver, and they deduced that the source of this corruption was from the fracturing of an ancient and powerful artifact, A weapon given the name the [Spire of the Solar Wind](../../Things/Items/Spire%20of%20the%20Solar%20Wind.md). No one is sure what's has caused this artifact to fracture in two, only that the other half is out there somewhere, perhaps attached to the base of another shard, perhaps stuck at the bottomless depths of the [Cloud Sea](../../Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Cloud%20Sea.md).\n\nWhen [Myrrdin](Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md) left the [Shiver](../../Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver.md) to complete his [A'lawdrinaieth](../../Things/A'lawdrinaieth.md) he was tasked by the [Primevil Speakers](../../Groups/Primevil%20Speakers.md) to seek out a woman who's name was written in the stars directly at the zenith of the [The Forlorn Shiver](../../Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver/The%20Forlorn%20Shiver.md). A Women by the name of *Sidereum*. The Elders divinations could not reveal much more about this mysterious person, only that she would play an important role in the solution to this dire problem, and that perhaps [Myrrdin](Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md), guided by the stars themselves,  would be fortunate enough to cross her path.\n\n[Myrrdin](Myrrdin%20Chosaach.md) learned a little from the [crew](../Captain%20Amara.md) of the airship that he landed on. \n\nThe human empire lives on a far away [shard](../../Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/Shards.md) known has [Hearthen](../../Locations/Cloud%20Sea/Shards/Hearthen/Hearthen.md).\n\nThe *human king*, a spoiled and lazy scion of a powerful line, has recently been overthrown by his *younger sister*.

You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be found under `data/config.yaml`.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'ŸÖÿØŸàŸÜÿ™Ÿä'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-08T20:10:56.292827789Z","tags":["setup"]},"/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/).

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so, otherwise the generated page will not have a title!\n\nYou can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden.

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions Permissions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from modifying your files (for good reason!). However, Quartz needs this to write the actual site files back to GitHub.\n\nHead to `Settings \u003e Action \u003e General \u003e Workflow Permissions` and choose `Read and Write Permissions`\n\n![[notes/images/github-actions.png]]\n*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1. (IMPORTANT) Set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`\n2. Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

There are an overwhelming number of tutorials, resources, and guides for tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), yet none of them have super easy to use *free* tools to publish that garden to the world.\n\nI've personally found that\n1.

This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize hugo-obsidian as an executable.\n\n##  Installing Hugo\nHugo is the static site generator that powers Quartz. [Install Hugo with \"extended\" Sass/SCSS version](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) first. Then,\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\ncd \u003clocation-of-your-local-quartz\u003e\n\n# Start local server\nmake serve\n\n# View your site in a browser at http://localhost:1313/\n```\n\n\u003e [!INFO] Docker Support\n\u003e\n\u003e If you have the Docker CLI installed already, you can avoid installing `hugo-obsidian` and `hugo`.

It produces results that *exactly* match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\n  operandApiKey: \"jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf\"\n  operandIndexId: \"s0kf3bd6tldw\"\n```\n7.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile # again, (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup analytics?\nQuartz by default uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics. \n\nIf you would prefer to use Google Analytics, you can follow this [guide in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics). \n\nAlternatively, you can also import your Google Analytics data into Plausible by [following this guide](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import).\n\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\nüêõ [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-08T20:10:56.296827844Z","tags":[]},"/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?
